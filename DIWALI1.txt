AIM : Design automatic led Diwali lights (consisting of 6 led’s) such that it only works during night and can generate two patterns which can be toggled with switch. a. Pattern 1 – led blinks with a freq. of 500 msec. b. Pattern 2 – led blinks with a freq. of 1 sec.


Concept Used: When the LDR sensor senses Darkness the Lighting starts according to the coded program which can be controlled using the slide switch.

Observation:  It does not work.

Precaution: 1. The positvie and negative terminal of the LED should be connected properly to the Arduino.
	    2. The input for LDR sensor should be connected to A0.

Lerning Outcomes : 1. The use of slide switch.
	           2. The use of LDR sensor.
		   3. To keep practising Tinker Cad.
